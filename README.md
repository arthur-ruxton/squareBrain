# General Assembly
# Project 1 - squareBrain() :robot:

A maze game with three levels of complexity, which includes unique maze generation - achieved using an implementation / manipulation of the depth first search algorithm.

# Aim
* In one week, build a grid-based game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
* Use CSS grid or for an added creative challenge, use HTML Canvas. 
* It can be a direct clone of, or inspired by, an existing game. 
* The game should include logic for losing and winning.
* The game result should be displayed.

# squareBrain() - Overview.

* Press start and an animated, somewhat randomized, __maze-generation__ will begin, triggering a timer. Closely observing the __animated path-finder algorithm__ may help you solve the puzzle. 
* __squareBrain() has three levels of complexity.__ Navigate through all three mazes to complete the game.
* __Collect golden nugs__ to increase your score as you go, they’re rarer and more valuable on harder levels.
* __If time runs out__, it’s game over. 
* There are 'specialCells'. The program removes all walls of any specialCell as well as any wall touching it. This is done to ensure __multiple potential__ routes, through each maze.
